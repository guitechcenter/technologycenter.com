			<p>By listening to the crowd and asking for their contributions, organisations can gain firsthand insight into their customers’ needs and desires, and build products and services that 
meet those needs and desires. With an earned sense of ownership, communities may feel a 
brand-building kinship with the community through collaboration and contribution.</p>
	
	<p>Digital marketing is powerful in two fundamental ways. First, the audience can be segmented 
very precisely – even down to factors like current location and recent brand interactions – which 
means that messages can (and must) be personalised and tailored specially for them.
Second, the digital sphere is almost completely measurable – every minute and every click by a 
customer can be accounted for. In digital you can see exactly how various campaigns are 
performing, which channels bring the most benefit, and where your efforts are best focused.</p>

relationships with customers. 
Digital marketing helps to create consumer demand by using the power of the interconnected, 
interactive web. It enables the exchange of currency but, more than that, it enables the 
exchange of attention for value. This is referred to as the attention economy.
